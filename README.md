# 🍽️ johne.ai – Kitchens Rewritten

Hi, I'm Johne (they/he/she) — a chef, founder, and AI systems designer.  
I’m building **johnE.ai**, a human-first hospitality platform powered by ethical automation.  
From **Fló**, the kitchen scheduler, to **MEP**, the mise-en-place memory AI, this is a system for people like me — kitchen workers who deserve better.

🛠️ Actively building:  
- [Fló Scheduler](https://...) – AM/PM labor blocks, fair shift balance.  
- [MEP Assistant](https://...) – kitchen AI brain.  
- [Vision Docs](https://...) – from fire to future.


## 🧭 Core Beliefs

- 🧠 **AI should serve people**, not replace them  
- 🍳 **Prep cooks run the kitchen** — and they should be treated like it  
- ♻️ **Efficiency is survival**, but not at the cost of dignity  
- 🪵 **Build from scratch** when the system is broken

## 👀 Looking For

- Dev collaborators (especially ethical, open-source-aligned)  
- AI researchers with a heart  
- Anyone tired of bullshit in food systems who wants to help fix it

## ✨ What’s Coming

- Public testing on **Fló** and **MEP**  
- Open source logic docs  
- Kickstarter + community roadmap  
- A cinematic story: _From Fire to Future_
